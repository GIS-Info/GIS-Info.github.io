## How to Contribute

The information included in this project comes from many voluntary contributors who are graduate students, postdocs, and young faculties in various universities. We understand that some of the information is time-sensitive. We also understand that we are not able to cover all the relevant institutions, laboratories and professors in the world. Therefore, we welcome your contributions!

If you find that your institution is not included and would like to get them on our pages, or if you find any incorrect or outdated information, please let us know.

There are three ways to add information to this page.

**Method 1** (recommended): Go to the [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/gisphere/gisphere.github.io), find the page that needs to be modified, and add or modify it on the page, then initiate a Pull Request on GitHub. if there is no suitable country or region page for the school you want to add, you can add a Markdown file for that country. This method is the most efficient. We will review and merge your Pull Request after we receive it. Please refer to [this page](https://www.markdownguide.org/tools/github-pages/) for Markdown stylings.

**Method 2**: Go to the [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/gisphere/gisphere.github.io) and tell us what information you want to add or modify in [Issues section](https://github.com/gisphere/gisphere.github.io).

**Method 3**: Send us an email ([gisphere@outlook.com](mailto:gisphere@outlook.com)) with the information you wish to add or modify.

Contacting us using the latter two methods may require a longer wait for the site to get updated. Thank you for your patience and help!
