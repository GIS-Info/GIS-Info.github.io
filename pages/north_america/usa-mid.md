### The Ohio State University

Columbus, Ohio, USA

Unit: [Department of Geography](https://geography.osu.edu/)

The Department of Geography at Ohio State has a sizable international student population. Graduate students in this department work on two subjects, namely geography and atmospheric sciences. The master's program usually takes two years, and the doctoral program usually takes four years. The postgraduate study directions include environment and society, GIS and spatial analysis, physical geography and climate, and urban and regional studies. Many graduates of this department landed their careers in academia. After graduating from the master's degree, they generally stay in the department or go to other universities for a doctorate degree. Doctorate graduates usually become faculty or postdoctoral researchers in the USA or other countries. Some others work for agencies, and a small number of them go to industry and work mainly in GIS and data analysis, or hold scientific research positions. The overall training program of the department is for developing academic talents (see: [record of alumni whereabouts](https://geography.osu.edu/graduate-student-placement)). Many professors work in human geography but there are also faculty members working on GIS and physical geography, too. Not many people here specialize in GIS, but many are applying GIS techniques and methods to other fields, such as public health, transportation, natural resources, and the environment.
