### Boston University

Urban planning: [Metropolitan College](https://www.bu.edu/met/)

Metroplitan College in Boston University offers two [Master programs](https://www.bu.edu/met/programs/) in urban planning: The Master of Urban Affairs (MUA) and The Master of City Planning (MCP).

The Master of Urban Affairs degree program is designed for those seeking to develop a broad understanding of urban public policy, community development and service delivery, and the administration of public and private agencies in urban settings. The MUA provides the theoretical, analytical, and practical foundations for understanding the complexities of the urban environment.

Public health considerations related to climate change—from drought to flooding—and recurring global pandemics such as COVID-19 have widespread implications for the future of cities and their neighborhoods. Now more than ever, the way we plan our cities has a direct impact on the quality of our lives. BU MET’s Urban Affairs master’s program offers several courses that bridge the leading theories and practices in key areas such as environmental sustainability, land use, housing, and community development; infrastructure planning; public finance and transportation planning; and energy, climate, and urban design.

The Master of City Planning (MCP) at Boston University’s Metropolitan College (MET) will prepare you for a wide variety of professional roles in urban planning and management.

The city planner, now more than ever, has the opportunity to address some unique challenges. Apart from the technical, socio-political, and economic considerations that go into making an equitable, resilient and sustainable city, public health considerations related to climate change—from drought to flooding—and recurring global pandemics such as COVID-19 have further widespread implications. Planning for what comes next requires expertise in complex issues and policy areas that include environmental sustainability, land use, housing and community development, infrastructure planning, public finance, transportation planning, and energy, climate, and urban design.

When evaluating applications, we consider whether potential students have a sufficient knowledge of basic quantitative methods, the ability to write, and some familiarity with their desired topic of study. We admit students across the range of disciplines within the School and with a diversity of backgrounds. Incoming students should have completed a master’s degree (or its equivalent) before starting the program. In rare instances, exceptional students are considered after receiving only a bachelor’s degree or, for students enrolled in Bloustein School master’s programs, after completion of twelve credits of graduate coursework. The course of study—which includes required and elective classes, a comprehensive examination and writing and defending a dissertation— takes a minimum of four years, but often five or more.

### University of Puerto Rico

Urban Planning: [The Graduate School of Planning ](http://planificacion.uprrp.edu/?page_id=445)

[Master of Planning](http://planificacion.uprrp.edu/?page_id=43) with areas of emphasis in the fields of Urban and Territorial Planning, Planning of Society and Environment, Planning of Economic Development and Community. Current planning approaches are framed by changes in the international order of the economy (globalization), the decentralization of government and the transfer of powers and competencies to municipalities, and the greater participation of communities and the private sector in decisions and public interest interventions. Among the great challenges considered by the Master's Program of Study in Planning, are included: sub-urban sprawl, deterioration of the quality of life, inequality and social marginalization, and pollution and degradation of the environment and the natural resources observed on a global, regional and national scale in most countries, including Puerto Rico.
