Its faculty members come from different colleges of the university, and they are all engaged in GIS-related research projects with different application domains. The center has in-depth cooperation with the United States Geological Survey (USGS), the National Park Service (NPS), NASA, and Esri, and it is currently home to more than 250 students at masters and doctoral levels. The master's program offered by this center is the Master of Geographic Information Science and Technology (MGIST), which is the earliest of its kind in the USA. It is a 2-year course-based master's degree with 21 prescribed credits of GIS-related courses and 12 elective credits. A comprehensive project and a portfolio are also required. Most of MGIST graduates went to the industry. The PhD program of the Center for Spatial Analytics is interdisciplinary. Its duration is 4 to 5 years. Students need to use GIS and other methods to complete a research project in the domains of physical or social sciences. Members of the dissertation committee come from different departments according to the research topic selected by the student. This program also requires an industrial internship in the first two years in order to better integrate the industry, education and research experiences in student's future scientific career.

Professors in the center are all teaching-oriented faculty members responsible for the teaching and guidance of core courses like GIS. Doctoral students need to find their own scientific research interests and directions, and then find their own research advisors in any departments participating in the center’s project. Current doctoral supervisors of the center include faculty members from these following departments: Statistics, Oceanic, Earth and Atmospheric Sciences, Business School, Biological and Agricultural Engineering, Public Health, Park and Tourism Management, Landscape Architecture, Civil Engineering, Botany, Forestry, and Computer Science, etc.

The GIS program at Maine is affiliated with the  School of Computing and Information Science and various computer courses are offered. The department has two degree programs. The Master of Information Systems is industrial-oriented, and the Master of Spatial Information Science and Engineering is research-oriented. Its core GIS courses include spatial analysis, spatial interaction design, spatial database systems and others.

### Syracuse University

Syracuse, New York, USA

Unit: [Department of Geography](https://www.maxwell.syr.edu/geography-and-the-environment/)

The geography department at Syracuse University is affiliated to Maxwell School of Citizenship and Public Affairs, and most of its research topics are in human geography. Professors in physical geography are not common in this department, and the courses offered in the department are mostly in human geography, too. The class size is very small, mostly of about 10 students. The annual enrollment is about 5 students, masters and doctors combined (among them, 1-2 students are in physical geography and GIS).

Professors:

- **[Peng Gao](http://pegao.expressions.syr.edu/)**: erosion and sediment transport in rivers and watersheds, 3D GIS design and analysis for urban environments;

### University of Maryland

College Park (close to DC), Maryland, USA

Unit: [Department of Geography](www.geog.umd.edu)

The GIS program at UMD is reputable in image processing and its applications in land use classification, natural disaster monitoring, and the study of atmospheric changes. It is also known for the quantitative research on economic geography and human-natural system. There is not a traditional research-based master's program in this department, and only doctoral students have academic advisors. The two-year self-funded GIS master's program is an online program, which is taught in a hybrid form between online classes and face-to-face instructions. This program focuses on skill-building.  Students in this program usually land their careers in the industry after graduation. Professors doing GIS-related research are mainly with the [Center for Geospatial Information Science](https://geospatial.umd.edu/).
