### University of Denver

Denver, Coloardo, USA

Unit: [Department of Geography and the Environment](https://science.du.edu/geography)

Founded in 1864, the University of Denver (DU) is the oldest private university in Colorado. To 2020, the Department of Geography and the Environment is 75 years old. The department has a wide range of education and research concentrations in physical geography, environmental science, GIS/RS, and human geography. Two master's programs and one doctoral program, namely MS in GIS, MS in GIS (Online), and PhD in Geography, are operated here. MS in GIS is a traditional master's program, and most of its courses are taught face-to-face; MS in GIS (Online) is mainly for students who are already employed but want to continue their studies in GIS via remote instruction. Students who have obtained a master's degree can apply for the PhD in Geography program. GIS/RS related courses include cartography, spatial statistics, environmental/GIS modeling, ecological economics, spatial database, geovisualization, and WebGIS. The city of Denver is a transportation hub and information industry center in western United States. Many GIS-related agencies (e.g. USGS, USDA) and large companies (e.g. ESRI) have branch offices here. Many DU graduates are employed in these institutions, and there are many internship opportunities for GIS students, too. In addition, Denver is located in the transition zone between the Great Plains and the Rocky Mountains, with an altitude of more than 1,600 meters. It is nicknamed The Mile High City. There are more than 300 sunny days in a year. National parks and ski resorts can be reached nearby.

The Department of Geography is one of the oldest departments at University of Oregon. Originally, it was together with the geology department and later it became its own department in 1957. Alex Murphy, the former president of AAG, and Amy Lobben, the current presendent of AAG, are both there as faculty. This department is known for its programs in human geography, cartography, and spatial cognition. GIScience and spatial data scienc (including spatial analysis and geostatisitcs) has been rapidly developed there in recent years. In addition to degrees in geography, this department also offers an undergraduate degree in spatial data science & technology, and undergrads who completed their degrees could enter the 2-year masters program in this same department. Those who holds a masters degree could apply for the PhD program which lasts for 4 or 5 years. One thing to notice is that the PhD program requires a masters degree for entrance. The department encourages undergrads and masters students to continue pursuing a PhD degree. All admitted graduate students will be funded as a RA, TA or in other forms. Exceptionally good applicants might be provided with fellowships, such as [Raymund Fellowship](https://gradschool.uoregon.edu/funding/awards/raymund-fellows) and [Promising Scholar Award](https://gradschool.uoregon.edu/funding/awards/promising-scholar-award).

Unit: [Department of Geosciences](https://www.uaf.edu/geosciences/)

The geosciences department at UAF operates research projects in RS and GIS. MS and PhD degrees are granted there. This department hosts the 3 most important GIS-related cyberinfrastructures of Alaska:

- [Alaska Satellite Facility](https://asf.alaska.edu/)：The warehouse of Alaskan satellite images
- [Geophysical Institute of Alaska](https://www.gi.alaska.edu/research/remote-sensing)：The host of geophysical data in Alaska and its surronding oceans
- [Geographic Information Network of Alaska](http://www.gina.alaska.edu/)：Provider of real-time Alaskan spatial and geographic data

Many of GIS-related projects in the department are based on these three infrastructures. UAF is has the highest latitude among all four-year universities in the United States. It is close to the Arctic Circle and also close to the Pacific Rim volcanic zone. Because of its unique location, the department has formed a unique research direction of GIS, namely the application of spatial science and geostatistics in the studies of polar environment and climate, glacial geomorphology, volcanology, and polar oceanography.
