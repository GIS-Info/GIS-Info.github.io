## About

This guide was launched in September 2019, and the latest update time is September 2020. Our purpose is to provide timely and comprehensive information regarding graduate-level programs in geographic information sciences (GIS) all over the world. Authors of this guide are from notable GIS programs, being either current graduate students, recent alumni, or young faculty. We mainly provide first-hand information about GIS-related programs and potential supervisors. We hope this guide can help those who are seeking graduate school opportunities in GIS.

If you find this guide useful, please help us by sharing it and staring [our GitHub](https://github.com/GIS-Info/GIS-Info.github.io/)！

**We thank [all authors](/authors) who contributed to his guide！**

This guide will be frequently updated in the future. We hope more people can join us to develop and maintain this project. We are not able to include all GIS-related graduate programs in this guide for various reasons. Please refer to [AAG Geography Program](http://www.aag.org/guide) for more information about other programs in North America. Please feel free to leave a message in [this GitHub issue](https://github.com/GIS-Info/GIS-Info.github.io/issues) if you find any errors or have any suggestions.
