The Department of Urban Planning and Design (DUPAD) was established in the Faculty of Architecture following the reorganization of the Centre of Urban Planning and Environmental Management (CUPEM) on 1 July 2008 to continue the teaching of urban planning and related areas in housing management and transport which can be dated back to 1980. DUPAD offers taught post-graduate and MPhil and PhD programs in Urban Planning, Urban Design, Housing Management and Transport Policy and Planning.

The Department of Geography of the University of Hong Kong has three research directions: China-related research, environmental research, and urban and transportation research. The department offers undergraduates, taught masters, research masters, and research doctoral programs.

The Department of Real Estate and Construction (REC), formerly known as Department of Surveying, was established in June 1984. The Department has now expanded into an even wider spectrum of expertise, covering virtually every aspect of land, construction, real estate, and conservation, with a growing interest in digital technologies and data analytics.
