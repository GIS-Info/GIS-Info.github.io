### University of Tasmania

Hobart, Tasmania, Australia

Unit: [School of Geography, Planning, and Spatial Sciences](https://www.utas.edu.au/technology-environments-design/geography-and-spatial-sciences)

The University of Tasmania is located on the island of Tasmania in southeastern Australia. It is the oldest university in Australia. Its Department of Geography, Planning and Spatial Sciences offers a two-year course in spatial science which leads to a degree of Master of Applied Science in Spatial Science. In addition, the department also has a doctoral course, the PhD in Environment. The department has a lot of cooperation with the environmental science department, and students in this department can also spend a semester at several universities in mainland Australia to take courses in geography or surveying/mapping. As the University of Tasmania is the southernmost 4-year university in Australia, many research projects related to Antarctica have been operated here. Some alumni of the school continue doing Antarctica-related research, or being a consultant in affairs related to Antarctica.

Unit: [School of Agriculture and Environment](https://www.uwa.edu.au/schools/agriculture-and-environment)

The School of Agriculture and Environment at the UWA offers a [master's degree program in GIS](https://handbooks.uwa.edu.au/coursedetails?code=71570). The duration of this program is 1.5 to 2 years. This master's program is course-based with six core courses, including GIS programming, remote sensing, GIScience, GIS environmental resource management, advanced spatial analysis, and GIS environmental science. In addition, the Faculty of Natural Sciences also operates doctoral programs, and the specific direction for the doctoral research is determined by the student's faculty advisors.

### Curtin University

Perth, Western Australia, Australia

Unit: [Department of Spatial Sciences](https://scieng.curtin.edu.au/schools/school-of-earth-and-planetary-sciences/spatial-sciences/)

Originally named Curtin University of Technology, the Curtin University is Australia's top school in geosciences. GIS-related graduate degree programs are operated in the department of earth and planetary sciences at Curtin. They include:
- Master of Geopatial Intelligence: a two-year class-based master's degree. In the first year, students need to take advanced courses in GIS, spatial analysis, database, visualization, and cartography. In the second year, students need to complete a scientific project. There is no requirement on the undergraduate major when applying to this program, as long as the candidates have some basic experiences in calculus and statistics and the English proficiency meets the school standards.
- Master of Philosophy in GIS: a 2-year research-based master's degree. In the first semester, students are required to take courses related to scientific research in geography. In the next three semesters, students should focus on scientific research and only take a few courses related to their own projects. Finally, a research project needs to be completed, and the direction of the project is usually related to GIScience, spatial analysis, geostatistics, GeoAI, and geographic big data, etc. After completion, those with excellent grades can choose to transfer to the doctoral program in the department.
- Master of Philosophy in Surveying and Mapping: a 2-year research-based master's degree, with the same structure as above, but the subject is mainly in surveying,  mapping and cartography, which are closer to engineering and GIS application. Because this university was traditionally a mining institute, programs related to mineral surveying and mapping are strong in this department.
- Ph.D. in Spatial Analysis: usually takes 4 years and needs to take advanced courses and complete an original research project. In principle, it is necessary for students applying to track to have a master's degree at the time of admission. However, particularly outstanding undergraduates (such as those who have honors on the college level or have taken a certain number of master's courses) will also be considered.
