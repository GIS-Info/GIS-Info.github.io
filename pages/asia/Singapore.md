GIS related departments：[Department of Geography](https://fass.nus.edu.sg/geog/)

The Department of geography of the University of Singapore has a master's degree in Applied GIS and a doctor's degree in geography. The main teaching and scientific research contents of this direction include GIS data processing, spatial programming, environmental modeling, network GIS and big data analysis. The Department is characterized by wide coverage and high degree of freedom. Project track and thesis track can be selected for master's projects, which are closely combined with environmental science.

Professors：

 **[Nawaz Muhammad](https://profile.nus.edu.sg/fass/geomn/)**: sediment source identification, erosion, sedimentation, renewable energy, multicriteria evaluation, and GIS applications in decision making

 **[Tang Hao](https://ap5.fas.nus.edu.sg/fass/hao.tang/)**: the use of satellite for mapping and monitoring terrestrial ecosystem dynamics under the changing climate and land use. Most of my work, linking remote sensing data, mathematic model and ground survey, aims to characterize spatial-temporal changes of 3D vegetation structure and its impact on nature and human society.

 **[FENG, Chen-Chieh](https://eminence365.wordpress.com/)**: spatial data modeling and spatial information theory; Cyberinfrastructure; GIS and education;

 **[YAN, Yingwei](https://profile.nus.edu.sg/fass/geoyy/)**: spatial big data analytics, citizen GIScience, volunteered geographic information;

 **[WANG, Yi-Chen](https://courses.nus.edu.sg/course/geowyc/)**: GIS and remote sensing applications, spatial epidemiology;

 **[Luo Wei](https://profile.nus.edu.sg/fass/geowl/)**: geovisual analytics, social network analysis, agent-based epidemic modeling, infectious disease surveillance and control;

 **[LUO, Xiangzhong (Remi)](https://profile.nus.edu.sg/fass/geolx/)**:terrestrial carbon cycle, eddy covariance, dynaic vegetation models, leaf traits;



 **[Filip Biljecki](https://profile.nus.edu.sg/sde/akifb/stf_akifb.htm)**:urban analytics, 3D city modeling, machine learning, spatial data quality, spatial data uncertainty.
