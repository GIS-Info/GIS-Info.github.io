### University of Canterbury

Christchurch, New Zealand

Unit: [School of Earth and Environment](https://www.canterbury.ac.nz/science/schools-and-departments/earth-and-environment/)

The University of Canterbury is located in Christchurch, the largest city on the South Island of New Zealand. The whole city was developed as a result of this university. The founders of UC are alumni from the Christ Church College of the Oxford University in England, and that was how this city got its name. This university was the first university in the Commonwealth countries to award degrees to women. The School of Earth and Environment at UC operates the Master of Geospatial Science and Technology degree program. This program is 1-year long and mainly class-based. Its core courses include GIS programming, spatial analysis, and GIS research methods. The degree is designed to lay the foundation of future PhD studies for students. Some alumni also went to the industry and working in fields like GIS analysis, GIS development, and urban planning. At the same time, the school also grants PhD in Geography, which usually takes 3 to 4 years to complete.

#### University of Otago

Dunedin, New Zealand

Unit: [School of Surveying](https://www.otago.ac.nz/surveying/index.html)

The School of Surveying at Otago has 3 master's degree programs (MS, MSur, and MAppSc-GIS) and a doctoral program (PhD). Among them, MS (Master of Science) and MSur (Master of Surveying and Mapping) are thesis-based two-year degrees, while MAppSc-GIS (Master of Applied Science in Geographic Information Systems) could be either the 2-year thesis+paper track or the 1-year thesis-only track. The admission for MSur requires an undergraduate degree in surveying and mapping, while the admission for MS and MAppSc-GIS requires a bachelor's degree in GIS, surveying, information sciences, geography, or in other disciplines with sufficient GIS or remote sensing experience. The doctoral degree is a 3-year program and mainly focuses on surveying and mapping, and a master's degree in related majors is required at the time of admission.
