### Curtin University

Perth, Western Australia, Australia

Unit: [Department of Spatial Sciences](https://scieng.curtin.edu.au/schools/school-of-earth-and-planetary-sciences/spatial-sciences/)

Originally named Curtin University of Technology, the Curtin University is Australia's top school in geosciences. GIS-related graduate degree programs are operated in the department of earth and planetary sciences at Curtin. They include:
- Master of Geopatial Intelligence: a two-year class-based master's degree. In the first year, students need to take advanced courses in GIS, spatial analysis, database, visualization, and cartography. In the second year, students need to complete a scientific project. There is no requirement on the undergraduate major when applying to this program, as long as the candidates have some basic experiences in calculus and statistics and the English proficiency meets the school standards.
- Master of Philosophy in GIS: a 2-year research-based master's degree. In the first semester, students are required to take courses related to scientific research in geography. In the next three semesters, students should focus on scientific research and only take a few courses related to their own projects. Finally, a research project needs to be completed, and the direction of the project is usually related to GIScience, spatial analysis, geostatistics, GeoAI, and geographic big data, etc. After completion, those with excellent grades can choose to transfer to the doctoral program in the department.
- Master of Philosophy in Surveying and Mapping: a 2-year research-based master's degree, with the same structure as above, but the subject is mainly in surveying,  mapping and cartography, which are closer to engineering and GIS application. Because this university was traditionally a mining institute, programs related to mineral surveying and mapping are strong in this department.
- Ph.D. in Spatial Analysis: usually takes 4 years and needs to take advanced courses and complete an original research project. In principle, it is necessary for students applying to track to have a master's degree at the time of admission. However, particularly outstanding undergraduates (such as those who have honors on the college level or have taken a certain number of master's courses) will also be considered.
