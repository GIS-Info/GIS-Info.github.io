Delft University of Technology (TUDelft) is one of Europe's top universities of science and technology, with a long history and deep strength in the field of engineering. There are two GIS/RS-related institutions in TUDelft: Geomatics in the Faculty of Architecture and the Built Environment, and Geoscience & Remote Sensing in the Faculty of Civil Engineering and Geosciences. Geomatics puts particular emphasis on 3D Geoinformation, Smart Cities, and building environment. Geoscience & Remote Sensing focuses more on the applications of Remote Sensing and Geodesy in Atmospheric science and Earth system science fields.
