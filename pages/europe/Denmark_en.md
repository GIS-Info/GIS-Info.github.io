### University of Copenhagen

**Københavns Universitet (University of Copenhagen, KU)**

Denmark, Copenhagen, Copenhagen

Unit：[Section for Geography](https://ign.ku.dk/english/research/geography/)、[Section for Landscape Architecture and Planning](https://ign.ku.dk/english/research/landscape-architecture-planning/)

The University of Copenhagen has the Department of Geosciences and Natural Resources Management. The studies about GIS/RS mostly happen in the two sections. One is Section of Geography, the other one is Section of Landscape Architecture and Planning. The department has strong comprehensive strength in different fields like climate, hydrology, cities, and etc. The study program about GIS/RS is located under the Department of Earth Science and Natural Resources Management. The entrance degree for the master's program is bachelor's degree and the duration is 2 years. After graduating from the master's program, the student can continue pursuing the Ph.D. degree.

### Aalborg University

**Aalborg Universitet (Aalborg University, AAU)**

Denmark, North Jutland, Aalborg

Unit：[Land Management and Geoinformatics research group](https://vbn.aau.dk/en/organisations/arealforvaltning-og-geoinformatik)

Aalborg University's research about GIS/RS happens in the Land Management and Geographic Information research group under the Department of Planning, and the research scale is small. The University’s GIS/RS program is set up under the Department of Geography, but some specific courses in the program are taught by this group. The entrance degree for the master's program is bachelor's degree and the duration is 2 years. After graduation from the master's program, the student can continue pursuing the PhD degree.
