#### University of Southampton

Southampton, Hampshire, England

Unit:  [Geography and Environment](https://www.southampton.ac.uk/geography/index.page)

The School of Geography and Environment at the University of Southampton has a long history and is one of the top centers of geographic and environmental science research in the UK. The postgraduate programme offers a specialism in Applied Geographic Information Systems and Remote Sensing and is one of the few university institutions in the UK where postgraduate programmes focus on the application of remote sensing and its integration with environmental studies. Research in the School of Geography and Environmental Sciences is grounded in addressing some of today's major global challenges, including climate change, social and health inequalities, sustainable development; conservation of biodiversity; and poverty and decline. Research is divided into the following research groups: Earth Surface Dynamics (ESD); Centre for Environmental Science; Economics, Society and Governance; GeoData (for applied environmental research); Global Environmental Change and Earth Observation (GECEO); Paleoenvironmental Laboratory at the University of Southampton (PLUS); and Population, Health and Wellbeing (PHeW).

Most graduate programs in the UK are primarily taught programs, with Southampton's Applied GIS and RS program running for one year and three semesters, with the third semester devoted to completing a thesis. The programme offers a wide range of optional modules, from python development, remote sensing, health and wellness to environmental applications. Each year, different electives are improved and added to meet the research interests of the graduate students. Applications will generally be based on a GPA of around 80 GPA and will require a background in geography, physics, geoinformatics, environmental science, ecology, biology, geology and social sciences. If you have relevant work experience, the school will lower the GPA requirement. The PhD is a 3-4 year program, with two or three supervisors who are responsible for the research work of the PhD students and have their own office space in building 44. The university also operates PhD programs in [AI](https://www.southampton.ac.uk/wsi/aifs/index.page)。
