Enschede, Overijssel, The Netherlands

Unit: [ITC](https://www.itc.nl/)

The Institute for Geo-Information Science and Earth Observation (ITC) at the University of Twente was founded in 1950 as a response to the United Nations' efforts to help train professionals in  aerial mapping in developing countries. From there, the ITC has grown into an institute with a team of experienced researchers with various backgrounds and evolved into the International Institute for Geo-Information Science and Earth Observation (IIGSO). Since January 1st, 2010, ITC has officially become an affiliated unit of the University of Twente, and the educational and research resources of both parties have been integrated and thus upgraded. ITC hosts six departments, namely ï¼š[Department of Earth Observation Science](https://www.itc.nl/about-itc/organization/scientific-departments/earth-observation-science/),Â [Department of Earth Systems Analysis](https://www.itc.nl/about-itc/organization/scientific-departments/earth-systems-analysis/),Â [Department of Geo-information Processing](https://www.itc.nl/about-itc/organization/scientific-departments/geo-information-processing/),Â [Department of Natural Resources](https://github.com/yeshancqcq/gis-info-data/blob/main/pages/europe/itc.nl/about-itc/organization/scientific-departments/natural-resources),Â [Department of Urban and Regional Planning and Geo-information Management](https://www.itc.nl/about-itc/organization/scientific-departments/urban-regional-planning-geo-information-management/) and [Department of Water Resources](https://www.itc.nl/about-itc/organization/scientific-departments/water-resources/).
