Climate and Environmental Remote Sensing](https://climers.geo.tuwien.ac.at/climers/)

The Department of Geodesy and Geoinformatics at the Vienna University of Technology has been famous since the 1990s. It has research groups such as microwave remote sensing, climate and environmental remote sensing, and geoinformatics. Andrew U. Frank has taught here for 24 years. Many professors and researchers in Europe once did a Ph.D. here. This department mainly has two programs. One program is for students of TU Wien. The entrance degree for the master's program is bachelor's degree and the duration is 2 years. After graduating from the master's program, the student can continue pursuing the Ph.D. degree. The other program is the European Erasmus Master of Cartography, one of which is a semester studying at TU Wien.
