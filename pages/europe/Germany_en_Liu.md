**Technische Universität Berlin (Technical University of Berlin, TU Berlin)**

Germany, Berlin state, Berlin

Unit: [**Institute of Geodesy and Geoinformation Science**](https://www.igg.tu-berlin.de/menue/ueber_uns/parameter/en/)

The Institute of Geodesy and Geoinformation Technology under the School of Planning, Architecture and Environment at the Technical University of Berlin is devoted to research on major geodesy, GNSS surveying, and geoinformatics methodology. Academicians such as Xia Jianbai and Wang Zhizhuo have studied here. The master's program of TU Berlin is mainly two-year, which is divided into surveying, computer vision and remote sensing, GIS, and other directions. After graduating with a master's degree, students can seek funding for spending 3 to 5 years to finish Ph.D.
