### University of Warsaw

Warsaw, Masovian Voivodeship, Poland

Unit: [Department of Geoinformatics, Cartography and Remote Sensing](http://geoinformatics.uw.edu.pl/)

The Department of Geoinformatics, Cartography and Remote Sensing at the University of Warsaw is home to a number of scientists engaged in research related to GIS, map design, and remote sensing image processing. The predecessor of this department is the remote sensing course in the Department of Geography that dates back to 1962. Later, this course was developed into the remote sensing laboratory. In 1969, built upon this laboratory, a separate department in geoinformatics was established. At the present, this department offers MS and PhD degree programs, and tits research focuses include:

-Application of high-resolution and hyperspectral images in mountain vegetation analysis
-Application of high-resolution and hyperspectral images in urban planning and structural analysis
-Application of remote sensing and satellite imagery in environmental change research
-Development of remote sensing and geoinformatics for environmental research

### Warsaw University of Technology

Warsaw, Masovian Voivodeship, Poland

Unit: [Faculty of Geodesy and Cartography](https://www.gik.pw.edu.pl/gik)

The Faculty of Geodesy and Cartography at Warsaw University of Technology is the oldest GIS-related department in Poland. It was established in 1921 and has a history of more than 100 years. Graduate programs of the department mainly include geodesy, cartography, and spatial planning. There are a total of 80 faculty members working in 8 departments within this faculty. Among them, geodesy and cartography have master's and doctoral degree programs, while spatial planning only has a master's degree. The specific directions of geodesy and cartography include geodesy, real estate management, remote sensing, cartography, geographic information systems, spatial information science, and mobile map and navigation. Among them, mobile map and navigation have a master's degree program taught in English. The specific directions of space planning include urban design and environmental space planning.

Departments:

- **Geodesy and Geodetic Astronomy**: geodesy, geodynamics, GNSS, earth motions;
- **Spatial Planning and Environments**: spatial planning and development, rural areas, urban sciences;
- **Engineering Geodesy and Control-Measuring Systems**: modern geodetic measurement technologies;
- **Photogrammetry, Remote Sensing and Spatial Information Systems**: airborne and satellite sensors, multi-sensor data, 3D models development, close-range images, computer vision, machine learning algorithms;
- **Cartography**: map design, big data mapping, generalization algorithms, map projections;
- **Cadastre and Land Management**: real estate cadaster, real estate divisions and consolidations, real estate valuation, land exchange and consolidation in rural areas, geodetic and planning studies related to rural development, geodetic works for agriculture, forestry and melioration;
- **Astro-Geodetic Observatory**: geodesy, GPS, observatory station;
